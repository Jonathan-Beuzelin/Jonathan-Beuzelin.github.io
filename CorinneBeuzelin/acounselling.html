      <h1>Autism counselling</h1>
      <h2>Treating you as the person and not the diagnosis.</h2>
      <p>I have decided to specialise in Counselling individuals on the Autism spectrum and Counselling parents, carers and partners of
        individuals with Autism. I am passionate about Autism acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>Using my personal and professional experience, I aim to help you talk about and make sense of the feelings you may be experiencing
        which can be created by the daily difficulties of being autistic. Autism can make a person's daily life a challenge,social
        interaction can be difficult.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h3>You may be facing:</h3>
        <li>Feeling that you're different</li>
        <li>Fear, isolation and bullying</li>
        <li>low self-esteem in a world where differences are still accepted with difficulty.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>Our sessions will seek to:</h3>
        <li>Talking about those feelings can help achieve resolutions</li>
        <li>Finding practical strategies to cope with problems you encounter in your daily life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>PLEASE NOTE : I am not qualified to give a diagnosis of Autism. I do not counsel individuals under 13.</p>
      <h3>I also provide services for parents, carers and spouses/partners</h3>
      <p>Finding out that your child, relative or partner has autism can be a confusing, scary and isolating experience and the day- to-
        day care certainly brings regular challenges. Being able to talk honestly and without being judged about what you are going through
        can help.
