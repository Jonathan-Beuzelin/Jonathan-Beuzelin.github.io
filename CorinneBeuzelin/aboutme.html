      <h1>About me</h1>
      <img src="corinnebeuzelin.jpg" alt="">
      <p>I worked for the NHS as a care assistant, looking after elderly people with Alzheimer and dementia.</p>
      <p>After moving to Gloucestershire, one of my children was diagnosed with Autism which prompted me to set up
        and run a support group for parents and carers of special needs children and young people.</p>
      <p>I am fluent in both English and French and taught French for a while. I encountered different people from
        all walks of life who were learning the language for loads of different reasons. I really enjoyed this experience.</p>
      <p>Having faced some complex and challenging events through my life, I got to a point when i started to struggle with my everyday life,
        experiencing depression and panic attacks. Although anti-depressants helped, i wanted a more long-lasting solution.
        I seeked Counselling and I gained so much from the process that I decided to do my training and become a counsellor
        to be able to deliver similar support to others.</p>
      <p>I have been on both side of counselling, as a client and as a counsellor, and can understand how difficult it is to make the decision of having counselling.
        I believe it takes a lot of courage to ask for help and really respect this.</p>
      <h2>Training, qualifications & experience</h2>
      <p>I trained with Gloucestershire Counselling Service, the biggest counselling service in Gloucestershire, for 5 years where I gained:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A certificate in Counselling Skills</li>
        <li>A diploma in Psychodynamic Counselling</li>
        <li>A Post Graduate Associate Award</li>
        <li>Since, I also completed a CBT Diploma and an Autism Awareness Diploma.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have volunteered with a service, counselling individuals with a wide range of issues like bereavement, divorce, child sexual abuse, relationship difficulties,
        domestic violence situation, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. I gained experience in working with people of different ages, ranging between 21 and 83.</p>
      <p>Since moving to Hull, as well as running my private practice, I also volunteered as a consellor for Survivors UK, which helps victims of childhood sexual abuse and rape.
         I then worked for a counselling service providing counselling for the NHS for 6 years.</p>
      <p>I regularly do further training, attend workshops to keep my practice updated, expand my knowledge on different issues and different models of therapy and I have a monthly supervision.</p>
      <p>I follow the Code of Ethics of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy of which I am a member.</p>
