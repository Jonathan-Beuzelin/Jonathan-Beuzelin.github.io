      <h1>About me</h1>
      <img src="corinnebeuzelin.jpg" alt="">
      <p>I worked for the NHS as a care assistant, looking after elderly people with Alzheimer and dementia.</p>
      <p>After moving to Gloucestershire, one of my children was diagnosed with Autism which prompted me to set up
        and run a support group for parents and carers of special needs children and young people.</p>
      <p>I am fluent in both English and French and taught French for a while. I encountered different people from
        all walks of life who were learning the language for loads of different reasons. I really enjoyed this experience.</p>
      <p>Having faced some complex and challenging events through my life, I got to a point when i started to struggle with my everyday life,
        experiencing depression and panic attacks. Although anti-depressants helped, i wanted a more long-lasting solution.
        I seeked Counselling and I gained so much from the process that I decided to do my training and become a counsellor
        to be able to deliver similar support to others.</p>
      <p>I have been on both side of counselling, as a client and as a counsellor, and can understand how difficult it is to make the decision of having counselling.
        I believe it takes a lot of courage to ask for help and really respect this.</p>
